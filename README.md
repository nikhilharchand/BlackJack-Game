# BlackJack-Game
Blackjack is a popular casino card game where the goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's, without going over 21. Players are dealt two cards, and can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards or "stand" to keep their current hand. Aces can be worth 1 or 11, and face cards are worth 10.
